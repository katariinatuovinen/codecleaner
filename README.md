The C code cleaner
The program removes comments and empty lines from a file written in C syntax.
It takes input files as parameters and creates new clean files with named
"filename1.clean"

Building & using
Run 'make' to build the program. After that run the program with e.g './main filename1
filename2'. The new cleaned files can be found in the same directory with .clean
ending. The log file with name 'code_cleaner.log 'is also in the main directory.
If you want to clean everything, use 'make clean'.
